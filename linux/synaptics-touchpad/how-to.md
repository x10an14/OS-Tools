Copy "50-synaptics.conf" from /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/ into /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/
Add the below two lines in the first "InputClass" section, under the line that has "MatchDevicePath "/dev/input/even"":
    # Enable ClickPad as specified here: https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2322413&page=2&p=13578990#post13578990
