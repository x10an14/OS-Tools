Old comment: Ended up finding out that the nopwd rsa key I made for link #2 did the trick in the sshtunnel.service file in this folder.

Comment 02.03.2016:
Shit now works, the sshtunnel.service/systemd script, the update_sshtunnel_systemd_service.sh, and home_ssh_config_* files!

NB(!): The install script doesn't work, but command is there for use.
